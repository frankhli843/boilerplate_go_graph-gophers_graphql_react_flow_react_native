# Main Purpose
- This project was created by me and its purpose is to prepare himself for his role as Frontend Software Engineer.
- Currently the company is using the stack:Go backend with graphql
  - Go backend
  - GraphQl
  - React frontend with Flow Typing
  - Electron app with web wrapper
- Thus this project will be a boilerplate that hooks all those together. 
- The backend comes from the boilerplate graphql-go. Please see License file for license usage.
- Hoping this is useful for someone out there looking to start a project as fast as possible :)
